                            the time, when I can, to visit the Disneyland Resort as a Guest.

                            My bank account hates me, but after a 17 hour day of work and school, the last thing I want to do is 
                            make food for myself. I have a passion for going out to eat and trying new and delicious dishes. I really enjoy all food.

                            I have not had the time to play in a while, but I absolutely love volleyball. I played in High School and 
                            it was one of my favorite past-times. I certainly have some fun memories playing with my friends.

                            I hired into the Disneyland Resort in February of 2015. 
                            I started out as a Merchandise Host in Tomorrowland. 
                            It was a lot of fun, and I realized that there were many opportunities
                            available throughout the company, so I continued to work and learn.

                            I became a supervisor (Working Lead) in my location about 6 months after I hired
                            into my role. I worked in Tomorrowland until 2017 when I transferred to Main Street.
                            I received a lot of professional growth, and was given opportunities to 
                            improve myself and learn new skills.

                            I started learning coding in May, 2020 through YouTube and Udemy courses. I always had an interest
                            in building software as I was very good with computers and technology. I spent many hours learning on my own, and
                            in October of 2021, I applied for an internal position as a Data Analyst at Disneyland. I was given an hourly position until May 2022
                            and was then promoted to a salaried role. Here, I have been learning how to build web-apps and have been given the opportunity to continue my education through
                            Disney's Aspire Program.
